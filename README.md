Activity 5: Feedback on Education Pathways application
Functional requirement: I believe that the system should provide more detailed information on the courses it recommends to students. 
Potentially adding the most recent version of the course syllabus to the website would be a good solution for this issue.
Non-functional requirement: I believe the system should have a more user friendly interface that would allow users to both learn and interact with the system easier.
A potential solution for this would be to add a introductory video on top of the page that would both introduce the system to the studetns and also teach them  how to use it.
